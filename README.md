# The Problem

The existing WAX CPU rental services offer users CPU rent at a cost of [1:100 to 1:580], but the Wax Power system provides ~800 WAX daily for every 1 WAX spent, which is much cheaper than all the services out there in the ecosystem. However, due to its complex system of renting from WaxBloks or WaxBlock page, or lack of awareness among users. Many users don't know about this service. Additionally, it only allows daily WAX staking and doesn't stakes for longer durations. 
The existing CPU rental system makes a whopping revenue of ~58% (2.2M WAXP). In contrast, if our automated powerup system were used, it would burn this much WAXP on a year-on-year basis, notably (180K WAX month-on-month basis). This would make WAX a deflationary token and strengthen its overall usage in the ecosystem.

# Project Overview

Right now many users facing issues with cpu & don't own enough stake in cpu. Here comes the role of cpu renting, but as of now most of the available rental services cost more than they should be, also those renting services not helping the wax ecosystem directly as wax they are collecting through renting services isn't getting burned. Instead, if users use wax powerup to boost the CPU it directly burns the waxp. It's beneficial for the wax ecosystem as it's burning waxp & user's getting it lot cheaper than other services. But the problem here, most users aren't familiar with waxblock & powerup gives max 24h rental. Our dapp with simple and minimalistic UI helps user rent CPU from Wax powerup easily & for multiple days.

By developing an automated powerup system, we will simplify the CPU renting process, making it more user-friendly and accessible. This system will enable users to stake WAX for extended durations, eliminating the need for daily management and ensuring continuous access to CPU resources. This automation will not only streamline operations but also educate users about the cost benefits of the Wax Powerup system. based on the historical usage of CPU of the users can also add suggestion to the users to stake x amount of wax !

Moreover, our solution will shift the revenue dynamics within the ecosystem. Currently, existing CPU rental services generate a significant revenue of ~58% (2.2M WAXP). By adopting our automated powerup system, this revenue will instead be burned on a year-on-year basis (notably 180K WAX month-on-month), contributing to the deflation of the WAX token. This deflationary effect will enhance the token's value and strengthen its overall utility within the ecosystem.

# Tech Stack

**For the Frontend part we will be using :**
1. React.js
2. Wax.js
3. Cloud Wallet plugin
4. Anchor Wallet plugin
5. Wombat Wallet plugin

**Backend:**
1. WAX smart contract
2. C++ (WAXP blockchain native language)

# License

MIT License along side we will Opensource our smart contract codes and the frontend codes so that if some user want he can interact with the side on its own localhost too.
